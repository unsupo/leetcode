- String

A cell `(r, c)` of an excel sheet is represented as a string `"<col><row>"` where:

* `<col>` denotes the column number `c` of the cell. It is represented by **alphabetical letters**.  
   * For example, the `1st` column is denoted by `'A'`, the `2nd` by `'B'`, the `3rd` by `'C'`, and so on.
* `<row>` is the row number `r` of the cell. The `rth` row is represented by the **integer** `r`.

You are given a string `s` in the format `"<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>"`, where `<col1>` represents the column `c1`, `<row1>` represents the row `r1`, `<col2>` represents the column `c2`, and `<row2>` represents the row `r2`, such that `r1 <= r2` and `c1 <= c2`.

Return _the **list of cells**_ `(x, y)` _such that_ `r1 <= x <= r2` _and_ `c1 <= y <= c2`. The cells should be represented as **strings** in the format mentioned above and be sorted in **non-decreasing** order first by columns and then by rows.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/08/ex1drawio.png) 


**Input:** s = "K1:L2"
**Output:** ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]
**Explanation:**
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrows denote the order in which the cells should be presented.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/09/exam2drawio.png) 


**Input:** s = "A1:F1"
**Output:** ["A1","B1","C1","D1","E1","F1"]
**Explanation:**
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrow denotes the order in which the cells should be presented.

**Constraints:**

* `s.length == 5`
* `'A' <= s[0] <= s[3] <= 'Z'`
* `'1' <= s[1] <= s[4] <= '9'`
* `s` consists of uppercase English letters, digits and `':'`.

**Hints:**
- From the given string, find the corresponding rows and columns.
- Iterate through the columns in ascending order and for each column, iterate through the rows in ascending order to obtain the required cells in sorted order.
