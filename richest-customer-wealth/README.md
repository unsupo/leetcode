You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​` customer has in the `j​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ bank. Return _the **wealth** that the richest customer has._

A customer's **wealth** is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum **wealth**.

**Example 1:**


**Input:** accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation** **:**
`1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
` `2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
`Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

**Example 2:**


**Input:** accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation**: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

**Example 3:**


**Input:** accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
**Output:** 17

**Constraints:**

* `m == accounts.length`
* `n == accounts[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 50`
* `1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100`

**Hints:**
- Calculate the wealth of each customer
- Find the maximum element in array.
