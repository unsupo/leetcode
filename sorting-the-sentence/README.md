A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be **shuffled** by appending the **1-indexed word position** to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

* For example, the sentence `"This is a sentence"` can be shuffled as `"sentence4 a3 is2 This1"` or `"is2 sentence4 This1 a3"`.

Given a **shuffled sentence** `s` containing no more than `9` words, reconstruct and return _the original sentence_.

**Example 1:**


**Input:** s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
**Output:** "This is a sentence"
**Explanation:** Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.
**Example 2:**


**Input:** s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"
**Output:** "Me Myself and I"
**Explanation:** Sort the words in s to their original positions "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers.
**Constraints:**

* `2 <= s.length <= 200`
* `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from `1` to `9`.
* The number of words in `s` is between `1` and `9`.
* The words in `s` are separated by a single space.
* `s` contains no leading or trailing spaces.

**Hints:**
- Divide the string into the words as an array of strings
- Sort the words by removing the last character from each word and sorting according to it
