There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the `ith` kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return _a boolean array_ `result` _of length_ `n`_, where_ `result[i]` _is_ `true` _if, after giving the_ `ith` _kid all the_ `extraCandies`_, they will have the **greatest** number of candies among all the kids_ _, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

Note that **multiple** kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.

**Example 1:**


**Input:** candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
**Output:** [true,true,true,false,true] 
**Explanation:** If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

**Example 2:**


**Input:** candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
**Output:** [true,false,false,false,false] 
**Explanation:** There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

**Example 3:**


**Input:** candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
**Output:** [true,false,true]

**Constraints:**

* `n == candies.length`
* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
* `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`

**Hints:**
- Use greedy approach. For each kid check if candies[i] + extraCandies â‰¥ maximum in Candies[i].
