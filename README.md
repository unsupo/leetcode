# leetcode

---

The purpose of this is to download the question and make
a template of the examples given.

This makes it easy to test locally and add notes if needed.


### TODO
- Support more languages
- Turn into an easy to use CLI
- Determine types and use the types instead of examples
- Support more data like hints, similar questions
- grab a new question not just one from a link
